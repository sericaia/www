You've decided to embark on the journey to microservices. Cloud 66 and YLD teamed up to create a webinar about how to create microservices with Node.js and develop, test and deploy them.

It can be daunting to look at all of the work required to get things going: Node development, using micro services on your local machine using Docker, Docker infrastructure, service discovery, distributed logging, messaging - the list goes on and on.

This webinar will help you with getting started with microservices using Node.js, Docker and docker-compose.

Along the way, you'll get introduced to some of the Cloud 66 features that'll help you stay focused as you kickstart the process while avoiding many of the infrastructure tasks of a do-it-yourself approach.

Check the recording and reach out on Twitter to Daniela (Developer YLD, @sericaia) or Daniel (Developer Advocate Cloud 66, @foldingbeauty) if you have any questions.
