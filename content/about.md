Hello! I’m an engineer that loves to play with JavaScript. I’m using **React.js** for about four years and I've been using **Node.js** for almost six. I’m usually more front-end oriented but I also believe that Hapi.js is amazing. I worked with completely **different businesses** so far: travel, services/authentication, news, sports, tooling, health and e-commerce.

I’m always searching to learn something new and gain new skills (not only tech skills!).
Besides JS I love to learn new stuff with my 1 year old son and [**taking photographs**](/photography/). I do **pilates** twice a week and I tried yoga for two years before that. I played football for some years.

I already gave minimal contributions in some relevant **open-source projects**, but I never focused in one in particular. I am truly committed to the projects I am professionally in and I already **led some front-end teams**. I like to attend to conferences and meetups from time to time and I was a [**speaker**](/talks/) 20-25 times. I was the main **organiser of the [JS meetup](https://www.meetup.com/require-lx/)** in Lisbon, and Nodeschool Lisbon event for four years.

I also like **teaching** and I already created React.js/ES6/Node.js/GraphQL **training materials**, gave some courses in public events (meetups) and training in companies events (both on-site and remote). I also participated as a **mentor** on few CoderDojo Lisbon events.

My main interest areas are: web protocols, web security and accessibility. Btw, I volunteer 1hour/week to be with a blind 70yr old amazing hacker!
