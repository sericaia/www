React is regarded as the premier way to build large, fast Web apps with JavaScript. We're excited to announce that we're going to have another [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) Crash Course in London! YLD already hosted three free events in Lisbon and this will be the second one in London.

Whether you have just started to learn React, have read some articles about the technology, want to impove your skills or start practising it, please join us in **March, 7**!
You can also come if you have some specific questions, want to discuss an idea, or just want to play around. Either way we'll have some experts from YLD to help you out.

The course will cover the following topics:

- How components work
- Understand props and state
- Components and composition
- Stateless components
- How to handle events
- Understand React Lifecycle
- HTML attributes and validation
- Debug & Testing

The session meant to be really hands on and the course has a platform of exercices to get you started with React.
We strongly believe that learning by doing is the best way to learn, so examples and hints are given for each exercise (in a similar way to the [nodeschool.io](https://nodeschool.io/) workshops). We also recommend pairing with someone near you and ask for help when you're struggling with something.

The course is going to be held at the **Trainline HQ** and will start at **6pm**. We will be there untill 9pm playing around with React, eating pizzas and drinking beer. Everyone is invited, please don't miss your spot and be sure to bring your own laptop!
